# MissDiagnosis - An AI-Driven Electronic Medical Record System

MissDiagnosis is an AI-integrated **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** system designed to help doctors avoid potential misdiagnoses by analyzing inputs against recent global health outbreaks and patient history. This project was developed during the **6-hour Notion Hackathon at Grambling State University**, combining the power of AI and Notion integration to build an impactful healthcare solution.

---

## üèÜ **Project Overview**
MissDiagnosis leverages:
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for analyzing diagnoses against current health outbreak trends.
- **Custom CNN model** for malaria detection using blood sample data.
- **Global health outbreak tracking** integrated from WHO Disease Outbreak News.

### ü©∫ **Core Functionalities**
1. **Diagnosis Analysis**
   - Doctors input symptoms, medical history, and diagnoses into the EMR.
   - GPT-4o validates the input against recent outbreaks and epidemiology data.
   - It provides tailored feedback and suggests possible tests to refine the diagnosis.

2. **Malaria Prediction**
   - Uses a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to analyze blood sample data.
   - Predicts whether a patient has malaria based on the input image.

3. **Outbreak Monitoring**
   - Scrapes WHO's Disease Outbreak News for the latest updates.
   - Recent outbreaks are cross-validated to improve diagnosis accuracy.

4. **Notion Integration**
   - Outbreak data is dynamically stored in Notion for record-keeping and easy updates.

## üíª **Setup and Installation**
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key
- Notion Integration Token
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Selenium (automatically installs ChromeDriver)
- BeautifulSoup4

### **Installation Steps**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MissDiagnosis.git
   cd MissDiagnosis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NOTION_KEY=your_notion_integration_token
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The Flask server will run on `http://localhost:1000`.

5. **Access the Frontend**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:1000` to access the home page.
   - Use `/dashboard` for the main EMR input interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
1. **Input Data:**
   - The doctor inputs patient symptoms, medical history, diagnosis, and prescriptions into the dashboard.

2. **Malaria Detection:**
   - The custom CNN model predicts malaria infection status using blood image data.

3. **Outbreak Validation:**
   - The backend scrapes WHO Outbreak News for recent epidemic updates.
   - Notion API stores the data in a dedicated database.

4. **GPT-4o Analysis:**
   - GPT-4o analyzes the diagnosis against the outbreak data, symptoms, and malaria prediction.
   - Returns feedback and further test suggestions.

5. **Output:**
   - Real-time analysis is displayed on the dashboard for quick decision-making.

## üß† **Inspiration**
MissDiagnosis was inspired by the challenges faced during the **Ebola** and **Lassa fever** epidemics in Nigeria, where diseases were frequently misdiagnosed as malaria due to overlapping symptoms and lack of awareness.

---

## üìù **Future Improvements**
- Integration of **more medical-specific LLMs** from Hugging Face for diagnosis.
- Implement a user authentication system for secure EMR storage.
- Expand disease detection capabilities with additional models.
- Real-time WHO API integration for automated outbreak updates.
